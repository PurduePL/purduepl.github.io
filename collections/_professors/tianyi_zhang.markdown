My research is in the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction, Software Engineering, and AI. I am broadly interested in building interactive intelligent systems that (1) augment human intelligence with data-driven insights and (2) augment machine intelligence with human guidance. Most of my work is designed for people in the programming domain, including software developers, novice programmers, and computer end-users.
