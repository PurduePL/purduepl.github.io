The university requires all graduate students and post-docs to conduct field-specific Responsible Conduct of Research (RCR) training in addition to the more general one that many of you have already completed.

To help new PurPL-ers satisfy this requirement (and get older PurPL-ers back on the straight and narrow), we are organizing a roundtable at this week's seminar, for discussing scientific reproducibility, data validity, plagiarism, research integrity, and other topics relevant to RCR in a more specific scope of PL, ML, and Systems at large.

From 12:30-1:30, PurPL professors will discuss the aforementioned RCR topics, fielding questions from the audience. Afterwards, we encourage students to form small groups to carry on the discussion from 1:30-2:30. The University requires 2 hours of field-specific training, so the small group participants will completely satisfy this (University mandated) requirement.
