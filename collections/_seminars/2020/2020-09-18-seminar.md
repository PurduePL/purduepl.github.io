bio: "Shaz Qadeer works at Novi, a group at Facebook aiming to build large-scale financial services.  He is currently working on two projects: (1) Move, the programmable piece of the Libra blockchain ([https://github.com/libra/libra](https://github.com/libra/libra)), and (2) CIVL, a reifier for concurrent programs ([https://civl-verifier.github.io/](https://civl-verifier.github.io/)). His research interests span all aspects of development of robust and secure software."

Program reification is a new approach to the construction of verified concurrent programs and their proofs.  This approach simplifies and scales (human and automated) reasoning by enabling a concurrent program to be represented and manipulated at multiple layers of abstraction.  These abstraction layers are chained together via simple program transformations; each transformation is justified by a collection of automatically checked verification conditions. Program reification makes proofs maintainable and reusable, specifically eliminating the need to write complex invariants on the low-level encoding of the concurrent program as a flat transition system.

We have designed and implemented CIVL, a reifier for concurrent programs.  CIVL has been used to construct verified low-level implementations of complex systems such as a concurrent garbage collector, consensus protocol, and shared-memory data structures.  CIVL is publicly available: [https://civl-verifier.github.io/](https://civl-verifier.github.io/).

This work has been done jointly with Bernhard Kragl (IST Austria).
