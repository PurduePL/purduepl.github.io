Learning on graphs has driven advances in scientific discovery, business modeling, and AI-assisted decision-making. However, two fundamental challenges hinder its broader adoption: (1) the scalability of expressive learning methods, particularly subgraph-based approaches, and (2) the need for privacy-preserving techniques to protect sensitive relational data. Both challenges stem from the intricate dependencies in graph structures, making traditional algorithmic and system-level optimizations insufficient.
In this talk, I will present a unified framework that addresses both scalability and privacy challenges in graph learning through algorithm and system co-design. For scalability, I introduce a family of efficient and expressive graph representation learning frameworks—leveraging walk-, set-, and hash-based representations—that eliminate the redundancy in canonical subgraph-based methods, enabling large-scale learning on billion-edge graphs. This same co-design principle extends to privacy-preserving graph learning, where structural dependencies in relational data violate the assumptions of standard privacy mechanisms such as differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). To address this, I propose a novel training framework that disentangles these dependencies, enabling the application of fine-tuning large language models on graph data in sensitive domains while maintaining robust privacy guarantees.
By jointly designing learning algorithms and system implementations, these solutions demonstrate how graph-based AI can be both efficient and trustworthy, unlocking new opportunities for learning from complex structured data in real-world applications.
